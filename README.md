# HR Analytics: Employee Attrition Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify which employees are most likely to leave the company, allowing HR to intervene and strategize to increase retention. This analysis is performed using a logistic regression model implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data to a suitable format for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that can better predict employee turnover.
- **Model Building**: Using logistic regression to build a predictive model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model using various metrics.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Offering actionable insights based on model findings.

## Key Skills Utilized
- **Data Analysis**: Proficient use of pandas for data manipulation.
- **Machine Learning**: Building and tuning logistic regression models with scikit-learn.
- **Data Visualization**: Using matplotlib and seaborn to create plots that visualize the findings.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Utilizing this tool for interactive coding sessions and presentation of results.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to validate the features and model results.
